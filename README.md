## Abstract
Career planning for students and early professionals is often hindered by fragmented job platforms, rapidly changing skill requirements, and a lack of actionable feedback from application outcomes. Existing tools are primarily reactive, stateless, and limited to short-term interactions. This project proposes **AI Career Architect**, a stateful agentic artificial intelligence system designed to manage and optimize a user’s career trajectory over an extended period. The system integrates resume analysis, real-time labor market intelligence, personalized upskilling, and automated job application workflows into a unified agent-based framework. By maintaining persistent memory and incorporating feedback from past outcomes, the proposed solution enables proactive and adaptive career optimization.

## I. Introduction
The current job search ecosystem requires users to manually navigate multiple platforms, interpret inconsistent skill requirements, and repetitively apply for positions without meaningful feedback. This often results in analysis paralysis and inefficient career decision-making. Conversational AI systems lack continuity, memory, and autonomous execution capabilities, motivating the need for a proactive career management system.

---

## II. Problem Statement
Students and early-career professionals face dispersed job information, ambiguous skill requirements, and absence of structured feedback. Existing solutions fail to provide long-term personalization or adaptive strategy refinement.

---

## III. Proposed Solution
AI Career Architect is an autonomous agentic framework that continuously manages a user’s career development by maintaining persistent state, executing tasks, and adapting strategies based on outcomes.

---

## IV. System Methodology
**Personalization:** Ingests resumes and portfolios to build user profiles.  
**Market Alignment:** Uses RAG for real-time job market intelligence.  
**Actionable Planning:** Generates DAG-based career roadmaps.  
**Feedback Adaptation:** Refines strategies using rejection and success analysis.
